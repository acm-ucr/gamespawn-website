        Projects are the pride and soul of Gamespawn. They are games made with
        blood, sweat, and tears (hopefully not) made by our brilliant members of
        the club. Each project is led by usually one (sometimes multiple) lead
        to which everyone on that team works towards creating a playable game by
        the end of their 10 week journey. Keep in mind that we are still
        students with responsibilities outside of Gamespawn so even if it
        doesn&apos;t look the best, all we strive for is something finished, not
        a masterpiece.
